# Malware Classification
> The main objective was to produce a classification algorithm to accurately classify malware images (generated from malware files) using Deep learning. Adversarial examples are generated with the help of Fast Gradient Signed Method (FGSM)

# Dataset Used
The dataset used for this project is viewable at [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/keerthicheepurupalli/malimg-dataset9010)

# Research paper
The key idea to compare a custom CNN against transfer learning models was taken from [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.16108.pdf)

# Methodology
1. The raw data contains the hexadecimal representation of the fileâ€™s binary content. Convert those files into PNG images.
2. Data Analysis to find the number of images in each class and further preprocessing
3. Generates batches of normalized tensor image data from the respective data directories.
4. Generate a CNN based model and train on the dataset. Also trying to incorporate transfer learning and ensemble techniques.
5. Analyse the generated output in terms of the accuracy of classification using confusion matrix and weighted f1-score
6. Generate Adversarial examples using FGSM.
